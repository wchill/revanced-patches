This is a fork of https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches that includes extra patches specifically for Boost for Reddit.

## Differences from official patch set
* Client ID, redirect URI and user agent are all patchable
  * Official patches do not patch redirect URI, and user agent is hardcoded. This makes Boost installations patched with official patches very easily detectable by Reddit.
  * See https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/pull/4551 for context.
* The content of deleted Reddit posts and comments can be loaded from [Project Arctic Shift](https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift).
  * This only works for text and images, and not all content can be restored. Videos are unlikely to be available.
  * Posts/comments that were deleted are marked as follows:
    * üóëÔ∏è if removed by the author
    * üßπ if removed by a subreddit mod
    * üöì if removed by reddit admins
    * ü§ñ if removed by anti-spam
    * ¬©Ô∏è if removed due to a takedown notice
    * üëø if removed by Anti-Evil Operations
    * üö´ if the subreddit is banned
  * Banned subreddits can be browsed with this functionality; however, rules/wiki pages are unavailable and the only sort option is by new.
  * In order to view a deleted post, you need to already have a direct link to the post. Subreddit feeds will not show deleted posts (unless the subreddit was banned); this is because of the lack of sorting options and the high likelihood of seeing a ton of spam posts.
  * Currently, this functionality is not working on user profiles. Removed posts you encounter on user pages need to be opened and refreshed for their content to load.
  * This feature makes extra network requests, so posts will load a little slower. In particular, retrieving images from the Wayback Machine is heavily ratelimited.
    * Caching is implemented to try and limit the impact of this.
* Imgur images and albums are automatically loaded from the Wayback Machine if a 404 is detected.
* The context menu for posts now contains additional options for opening a site in the Wayback Machine or archive.is. This is useful for if the undeleting functionality has issues or you want to bypass a content paywall.

## Instructions for patching user agent
Instructions on usage (from https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/1j4s7bd/how_to_fix_the_403_error_for_boost_using_revanced/):

1. Back up your settings in Boost and then uninstall it.

2. Grab a fresh copy of the Boost APK from [here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/ruben-mayayo/boost-for-reddit/boost-for-reddit-1-12-12-release/boost-for-reddit-1-12-12-android-apk-download/). Don't install it.

3. Change your ReVanced Manager settings to point to my patches as shown [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0094627f-fb5e-45fd-97f3-6ee24d21027e)

4. Create an installed app [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). For redirect uri, set it to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. You can leave about url blank.

5. Open the Boost APK in ReVanced Manager and make sure the Spoof client patch is enabled. For OAuth client ID, copy the random looking text from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps (below "Installed app"). Leave Redirect URI alone. For User agent, set it to something like `android:com.yourusername.reddit:v1.0 (by /u/yourusername)` (replace with your username).

6. Patch and install, your Boost should work now. You can restore your settings using the backup you made earlier.

# FAQ

The patches don't show up in the patcher after I change the source

* The patcher is buggy and sometimes the patches don't show up. Try force closing the app, clearing app cache and then reopening the app (may take several attempts). You can also try toggling Wi-Fi off and/or toggling airplane mode before reopening the app.

I get "Error: Invalid request to Oauth API"

* Your redirect URI is probably wrong. It has to match exactly between the patching settings and your reddit installed app. If you're reusing an installed app you made before, then update the URI at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/. Make sure you don't add `/` at the end.

I still get 403 Blocked

* User agent needs to follow the format above. If you fill it in with garbage, it will eventually be blocked by reddit. Also, reddit blocks any mention of rubenmayayo in the user agent.
* Your user agent can also be blocked due to other terms: a user reported that he was getting 403 after patching, and it turned out to be because his username included `isfun` (which triggers a block from reddit's side due to them blocking the app Reddit is Fun).

I get 401 when I open the app

* You probably created a web app instead of an installed app. Delete the app, create an installed app and then repatch with the new client ID.
* Don't use autofill when logging into Reddit. Manually type in or copy+paste your password.

I'm getting 400 Bad Request while logged in

* Try logging out and logging back in if you didn't uninstall the app in step 1

I can't check the box for Spoof client; I get `Notice: This patch contains a required option that is not supported by this app`

* Go to settings and toggle "Version compatibility check". I don't know why this fixes it

I get a `null: null` error when I open the app

* Your client ID is incorrect, check that you copied it correctly

Can I skip any steps if I was using the moderator workaround

* No, you have to follow all of the above steps
